# 🧮 Mini Calculator in Python

This is my very first Python project — a simple mini calculator!  
It includes two different versions of a basic calculator built using Python, created as part of my early programming practice.

## 📌 Purpose
To demonstrate basic Python skills such as:
- Taking user input
- Performing arithmetic operations
- Using variables and conditional logic

This project is also part of my portfolio for future roles in AML / Compliance, where Python and SQL knowledge is increasingly valuable.

## 🛠️ Features

### ✅ Version 1: Simple If-Else Calculator
- Takes two numbers and an operator from the user
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division
- Includes error handling for division by zero and invalid input

### ✅ Version 2: Enhanced Version with `result = None`
- Stores the result in a variable before printing
- Slightly cleaner structure, easier for future upgrades

## 🧾 Sample Usage

```bash
Please enter the first number: 10  
Please enter the second number: 2  
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): /  
Result: 5.0
